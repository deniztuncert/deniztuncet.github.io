This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio: [deniztuncert.github.io](https://deniztuncert.github.io)

### About Me
I am a **First-Year Medical Student** at Istanbul University (Capa Faculty of Medicine) with a strong focus on **Computational Neuroscience**, **Bio-Medical Engineering**, and **3D Anatomical Modelling**.

### Current Research Focus
- **AutoElec:** Automated 3D EEG electrode localization using differential geometry and point cloud processing.
- **Hardware Design:** Custom-engineered mechanical chassis and shielding for neuro-acquisition systems.
- **3D Anatomy:** Technical lead in digitizing anatomical education via 3D scanning and visualization.
- **Bio-Medical Signal Analysis:** Analyzing physiological sensor data using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for biomarker extraction.
- **Personalized BEM Model Construction via 3D Scans:** Transforming template Boundary Element Method (BEM) models into patient-specific models using MRI-independent photogrammetry.
